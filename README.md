## Description

MetaGlances is an application wrapper of Glances, a CLI curses based monitoring tool for GNU/Linux and BSD OS.

Glances uses the PsUtil library to get information from your system. It is developed by [Nicolas Hennion (aka Nicolargo)](http://www.nicolargo.com) in Python.

Check [github.com/nicolargo/glances](http://github.com/nicolargo/glances) for more details.

MetaGlances is developed by [Laurent Spinelli (aka Spin0us)](http://spin0us.free.fr), using jQuery Mobile Framework and some php stuff. It stores server configuration in the `localStorage` of the browser (not available in private browsering mode).
